# Text-to-Speech
Text To Speech is a technology which permits the conversion of text into speech sounds.
We can offer the text to be read in different voices according to our preference. A pause, resume, and cancel option is available so we can interrupt or resume the conversion. We can also alter the volume, pitch and rate of the audio.
